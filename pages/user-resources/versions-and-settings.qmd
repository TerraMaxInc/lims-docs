the little gear icon

versions
    title bar tells you what you have
    versions tells you what the most current is
    can also look at version history to see what's changed & why you needa given update
    theoretically, the first number means a breaking change, the second is about necessary updates for errors, the third is small stuff

settings
    work by editing the config file, that's why it matters
    date range
    read only
    test mode
