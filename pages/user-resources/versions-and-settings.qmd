This document explains how to view LIMS versions and know if you need to update, and how to change application settings.  Both `Versions` and `Settings` are found by clicking on the little gear icon in the top right corner of the program.

## Versions

Whenever I release a LIMS update, the new version will have a new version number.  Your local copy should tell you what your version number is in the top bar:

the little gear icon

versions
    title bar tells you what you have
    versions tells you what the most current is
    can also look at version history to see what's changed & why you needa given update
    theoretically, the first number means a breaking change, the second is about necessary updates for errors, the third is small stuff

settings
    work by editing the config file, that's why it matters
    date range
    read only
