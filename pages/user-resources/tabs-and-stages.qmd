title: "Tabs and Stages"
---

One tab for each "stage", stages are based off careful discussion with lab about their process; an attempt to model the real process as best as possible with the data structure

overall process flow

stages are points in the production cycle 
    have a batch number
    have either one microbial parent, or one or more microbial ingredients from the previous stage (except mother)
    are used as a parent or ingredient in the next stage (expect product)

all of these were pretty intuitive off the exisiting paperwork, except the drydown process splitting into stabilized and powder
    here the stages were decided because of the structure of the flow:
        a ferment might be split into many SL, and one SL might be split into many DMP
        DMP includes the liquid phase right before actual dry down, when some ingredients are added last minute
        there's arguably also a DDL stage, except one DDL doesn't ever split into multiple DPM
        SL and DMP could be argued as one big stage, except SL DOES sometimes (albeit rarely) get split into multiple DDL & DMP
        the exact lines of whether an input is added during the SL stage or the liquid half of the DMP stage
            not your problem, now handled by the auto-generated recipe
