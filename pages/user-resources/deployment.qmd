title: "Deployment"
---

Only two files, no other background stuff to install or delete

Process: I build & export, zip, upload to Dropbox, email ppl a link, the download it, unzip, and put where they want
    disadvantages: kinda of hacky, your computer thinks its a virus
    advatages to this: doesn't require me to learn 10 more things, stays self-contained, easy to remove

how files interact, need to be together
