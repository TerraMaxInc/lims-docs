title: "Deployment"

The user-facing application is published as two files in total:

- One single executable file for the application itself: `LIMS.exe`
- One separate text file that contains information to guide the application's startup: `config.json`

In order to install the application on your computer, you will be sent an email with a DropBox download link.  This link will download a zipped folder that contains both necessary files.







Only two files, no other background stuff to install or delete

Process: I build & export, zip, upload to Dropbox, email ppl a link, the download it, unzip, and put where they want
    disadvantages: kinda of hacky, your computer thinks its a virus
    advatages to this: doesn't require me to learn 10 more things, stays self-contained, easy to remove

how files interact, need to be together
