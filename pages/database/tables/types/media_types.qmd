## Purpose

To supply a list of media types for other tables in the database to reference.

This is one of the few tables in the database that has only one simple column.  I contemplated having a code and a separate name, but in this case the data seemed simple enough to not require that.

## Referenced By

- microbe_types.starter_media
- microbe_types.ferment_media

## Columns

| column name | data type | constraints | purpose |
|:------------|:----------|:------------|:--------|
| media_name | varchar(20) | Primary Key, Not Null | To be both the primary key and the list of media names |
