Database stuff...

integrated security?

simple vs full structure diagram

batches vs types vs recipes vs ingredients vs cfus vs other tables

naming conventions! \o/  
stage names, full vs one-word vs abbreviation
how words are combined

One page per table @_@  maybe can combine samey tables like batches into one page?
    but weirdy tables like version stuff and cfu_types need their own


Should have a how-to section:
    add new user
    view activity log
    add microbe
    add product type
    add new recipe version
    delete a batch
    query... things?
