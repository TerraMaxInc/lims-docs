[Database Tables](database-tables.html)

The heart of the LIMS project is the database.  Though most users never interact with it directly, the front-end application is defined by the backend structure.  And though the data it stores would be difficult for most people to access without the front-end application, it could theoretically be exported, moved, or connected to by other apps.

integrated security?

simple vs full structure diagram

batches vs types vs recipes vs ingredients vs cfus vs other tables

naming conventions! \o/  
stage names, full vs one-word vs abbreviation
how words are combined

One page per table O_o  maybe can combine samey tables like batches into one page?
    but weirdy tables like version stuff and cfu_types need their own


Should have a how-to section:
    add new user
    view activity log
    add microbe
    add product type
    add new recipe version
    delete a batch
    query... things?
