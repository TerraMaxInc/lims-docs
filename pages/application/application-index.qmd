This set of documents explains the refactored version of the LIMS WPF.

I decided not to document the original WPF because it wouldn't be worth the time and effort given that I intend to refactor it anyway.  I do also someday hope to refactor out of WPF and into Tauri, but that is a very long-term project that will require me to learn a lot more about Rust before I can start.  A middle-term refactor has seemed increasingly necessary as new needs emerged, and documenting the structure as I rebuild it is a way to plan and be intentional about it.
