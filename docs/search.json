    "text": "How to set it up\nUpdating to later versions is essentially the same process as installing. Because there are only two files, it’s just a matter of deleting the old ones and replacing them with new.\n\n1. DropBox\n\nWhen I create an update, I put the LIMS.exe and config.json file into a single zipped folder. Then I upload this folder to my personal DropBox so I can give people download links.\n\nThis isn’t the most streamlined or professional system. I do it this way because I like the clarity about what you’re actually putting on your computer.\n\n\n\n\n2. Download Zipped Folder\n\nI will send an email containing a download link to all people who need the update. Click the link, and it will open a page like this:\n\n\n\n\nDropBox Download Page\n\n\n\nDo not open the folder; this is harmless, but it won’t accomplish anything, and will just confuse the issue.\nRather, click on the download arrow button circled in the image above. THIS will properly download the zipped file onto your computer, into the Downloads folder.\nIt may pop up a dialog box asking you to log in or create an account. This is an irritating misdirect; you do not have to make an account. There should be a link at the bottom of the dialog to skip or continue on to download.\n\nNormally downloading executables from a link is a terrible idea, so only do this when it comes directly from me and has some explanation.\n\n\n\n\n3. Prepare Local Folder\n\nOpen the folder where you have the older version, and delete the contents so that it’s empty. If you haven’t installed LIMS before, create a new folder somewhere you can remember (this can just be on the Desktop) and name it “LIMS” or something similar.\n\nYou can create a shortcut to the application for daily use, but I deliberately kept the files simple so that you could manage moving and deleting them yourself\n\n\n\n\n4. Find Zipped Files in Downloads\n\nOpen the Downloads folder. You can find it by opening a File Explorer window (the folder icon in the bottom tray); the Downloads folder should be near the top of the folders in the lefthand panel.\n\n\n\n\nFind the Downloads folder in the lefthand navigation pannel of File Explorer\n\n\n\nThe zipped folder you just downloaded should be at the top of the files inside the Downloads folder, named something like TerraMax_LIMS_6.0. Open the zipped folder and find the two files inside.\n\nYou cannot run the LIMS.exe file from here inside this zipped folder, because it’s currently compressed\n\n\n\n\n5. Extract Zipped Contents to Local Folder\n\nExtract/unzip the files by simply copying them both, and then pasting them into the empty “LIMS” folder from step 3\n\nThere might be some small lag for the files to fully transfer, but it should work right away. As soon as your computer seems done with the task, try to open the LIMS file. If it doesn’t work, ask for help."

LIMS does almost all the work, but config.json contains a few instructions about settings and about how to connect to the database. Without a config file, LIMS will default to running in Test Mode, using internal test data instead of connecting to the real database.\nWhen you change settings from within LIMS, it saves those changes by writing them to the config file. It can’t change its own code once it’s compiled into a single-file .exe, so the external config file is necessary to make settings changeable.\nBeyond these two files, nothing else is added or changed; LIMS doesn’t install hidden components. If you delete the two files, there will be no other trace left on your computer.\nTo uninstall, you only need to manually delete these two files."

These two files need to be stored together in the same folder in order to work; LIMS.exe looks for config.json when it starts up and expects to find it in its same folder.\nThere are only these two files. Many applications will install a variety of configuration and support files in system folders, but for this project I wanted users to be able to keep track of what was on their computer, and be able to delete everything cleanly without worrying about leftover pieces.\nIf you delete these two files, then you have fully removed the program from your computer with no further cleanup necessary\n\nconfig.json\nA simple text file (.json tells the system to use it in certain ways, but you can view it like a .txt) containing settings that can be changed. The application references this file on startup to tell it what settings to use. These settings include some that you can change from within the app:\n\nUseTestMode - true or false, determines whether it connects to the real database or uses a small set of internal “test data”\nIsReadOnly - true or false, determines whether the user can save to the database or just view what’s already there\nDataTimeSpan - a number representing days, determines the date range of past data that the application fetches. It defaults to 365 (1 year) to save space and make the app run faster, but it’s possible to change to a longer range if you need to view older data.\n\nThe file also contains the connectionString, which you cannot change from the app. The connection string tells the app how to find the database, and should usually be left alone.

    "text": "Settings\nIn the window that pops up when you click the gear icon, the first Data Settings tab allows you to change and save a few settings that affect how the LIMS application runs on your computer.\n\nData Connection - Use Test Mode\nThis is an on-or-off setting that determines whether the LIMS application connects to the database or not. The default normal funcitoning is for this to be unchecked. If you check it then it will run in Test Mode and use a small set of internally-generated test data instead of connecting to the database.\nWhy use Test Mode?\nTest Mode offers a way to test the functionality of the application without making any changes to the real database. If you want to experiment with how the software works, this is a safe way to do that. It can also be useful for testing certain kinds of errors; if it seems likely that an issue is due to a connection issue, then using Test Mode is a way to check whether the error happens independent of the connection.\n\n\nRead Only - Is Read Only\nThis is an on-or-off setting that determines whether the LIMS application is in Read Only mode or not. When I send out updates I will usually set this for you in advance according to what your needs are, but it’s also possible to change it yourself. If it’s checked, then LIMS will run in Read Only so that you can view real data from the database but you can’t edit it.\n\n\nTime Span\nThis setting is a number that represents time in days. This will determine the Date Range of data that the application fetches from the database. Items like Mother Stock and Working Stock are all fetched no matter the date range, but for all other Stages LIMS will filter out everything that is older than the given number of days.\nThe default option is 1 year (365 days), and you’re given another selection option for “All Time”, and a third for a “Custom” time.\nThe purpose of this filtering is to improve the applicaiton’s performace. The more data it fetches, the longer it takes to load, and the more data is sitting in memory slowing down your computer. There are some situaitons where you might want to look up data about production from two years ago, but one year is plenty for most daily use.\n\n\nSaving Changes\nAfter you select the changes that you want to make to your settings, you need to click the Save Settings button at the bottom of the window. This will save the changes to the config.json file, so that they will be available the next time the application starts up and checks that file for details about how to run.\nYou will then be asked whether you want to restart in order to apply them now.\n\n\n\nChanges Saved Popup asks if you want to restart\n\n\n\nIf you click No, then LIMS will remain open and operting under the previous set of Settings, until you close it. Your changes will appear the next time you open LIMS.\nIf you click Yes, then LIMS will close, the loading animation will play, and it will re-open with the new Settings in place."

It will appear blank if you are in Test Mode.\nAt the top of the tab it tells you what the current latest release number is, so you can compare it with your own and know whether you’re up to date.\nBelow that are two tables; on the left is a list of Current/Past Updates. These default to sort of descending order by version number, with the most recent version on top. The table itself tells you what date a given update was released, what section/s the update affected, and then shows the beginning of a longer explanation of what the update did. If you double-click on a particular line in the table, then the full explanation will appear in the white space below so you can read about it.\nIn the table on the right is a list of Planned Updates, and works the same way as the Current/Past list. In theory it’s a way to track and communicate ideas about future updates, but has gotten a bit stale. All the items left in it are over a year old, and most were specifically requested by an employee who doesn’t work here any more and had somewhat divergent ideas about how LIMS should work. This was used more in the early days of LIMS development.\n\nVersion Numbers\nThe version numbers have three parts, which are meant to communicate the importance of the update.\n\nThe first digit on the left changing means a breaking change, something that fundamentally affects how the application interacts with the database. This usually involves some change to the backend database as well; either it was changed in a way that will cause older versions of LIMS to malfunction, or older versions of LIMS will add or edit data in a way that will undermine the newer data structure. Do not use a version with an outdated first digit unless you are using it in Read Only mode and never intend to make edits.\nThe second number is for big fixes or updates that are fairly serious and strongly recommended, but do not fundamentally change how the application interacts with the database. These are usually corrections of fairly serious errors that made LIMS unusable for certain tasks, or else additions of features that are significant but not essential. If your version is out of date in the second digit, you may encounter errors that have been fixed in later versions, but you shouldn’t be doing harm to anything but your own sanity.\nThe third digit is for smaller fixes and edits. These things are likely to be invisible except in specific, niche situations.\n\nThe difference between the second and the third level of importance is a bit of a judgement call on my part, but I try to use it to communicate the urgency of the update.\nIn general I recommend that you always update to the latest version, so that everyone is using the same version and I don’t have to trouble-shoot errors across a range of versions. But you can use this information about version numbers to judge whether you need to download an update immediately or if it can wait until you’re less busy."
