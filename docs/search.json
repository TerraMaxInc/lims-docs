Some parts will require knowledge of relational databases or SQL, but some parts are meant to be accessible to curious or ambitious non-technical users.\nApplication is for those who want to interact directly with the code of the front-end app to make repairs or updates. This will all be fairly technical and require programming knowledge.\n\nThis is a Quarto website. To learn more about Quarto websites visit https://quarto.org/docs/websites."

Use VERY sparingly, were mostly just there for the early days when transitioning from previous tracking system exception: added as defaults in final product, when you enter an unfinished product as instructions, idea is for those to get replaced with real batches in order to be compelteed\nlater stages depend on previous stages you can’t delete an earlier stage that a later stage is using b/c it would break the chain editing also gets locked down to a minimum"

    "text": "Each tab has particular functions, but some things are general:\nHow data connection works: on startup, it fetches the data once and then stores a local copy in temporary memory; unless you specifically update it, it will keep using this local copy that is not updated. this makes it run faster than constant refreshing, but you have to be intentional about refreshing yourself Refresh witht he circle arrow icon in the top right; it takes a minute. Also doesn’t refresh EVERYTHING, just the stuff that changes often. New microbes or recipes might not update; you need to close and restart the app for that Will do some limited updating after you save, in order to reflect your save and validate you. Don’t assume this is a full refresh\ntab patterns: data table of past stuff on the right, form on the left can sort table by any of the columns can double click to select an item and view it in the form on the left can clear out the selected item from the form by clicking “add new” checkbox\nthe left has a form for entering new items or viewing/editing details of existing ones. \nyou can also sort the righthand table by selecting microbe/product:\n    that both filters the table\n    and sets some defaults for the form to enter a new one of those\n    filters down ingredients and recipe stuff to what's relevant for that item\nclear out the item-specific filtering by clicking \"clear\" button at bottom"

These two files need to be stored together in the same folder in order to work; LIMS.exe looks for config.json when it starts up and expects to find it in its same folder.\nThere are only these two files. Many applications will install a variety of configuration and support files in system folders, but for this project I wanted users to be able to keep track of what was on their computer, and be able to delete everything cleanly without worrying about leftover pieces.\nIf you delete these two files, then you have fully removed the program from your computer with no further cleanup necessary\n\nconfig.json\nA simple text file (.json tells the system to use it in certain ways, but you can view it like a .txt) containing settings that can be changed. The application references this file on startup to tell it what settings to use. These settings include some that you can change from within the app:\n\nUseTestMode - true or false, determines whether it connects to the real database or uses a small set of internal “test data”\nIsReadOnly - true or false, determines whether the user can save to the database or just view what’s already there\nDataTimeSpan - a number representing days, determines the date range of past data that the application fetches. It defaults to 365 (1 year) to save space and make the app run faster, but it’s possible to change to a longer range if you need to view older data.\n\nThe file also contains the connectionString, which you cannot change from the app. The connection string tells the app how to find the database, and should usually be left alone. If there are connection issues, a database admin might want to edit this value.\n\n\nLIMS.exe\nThe entire self-contained app, appart from a few settings.
