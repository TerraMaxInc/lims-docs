The LIMS (Laboratory Inventory Management System) is a user-facing application that runs on users' individual computers and connects to a central database so they can view, edit, and add new data about TerraMax production. It mirrors an older system of paper forms to record the same data in a way that makes it easier to look up

It consists of two components:    

- The user-facing application, using **C#** and **xaml** in the **WPF** framework and **.NET** platform.
- The backend database, stored in a **SQL Server Express 2019 database** on a local server machine.

This documentation is organized into three sections:

[User Resources](pages/user-resources/user-index.html) is for *non-technical* users who want a reference for how to set up, use, or troubleshoot the application. 

[Database](pages/database/database-index.html) is for anyone who wants to dig a bit deeper into the backend, whether to actively work on maintenance or updates, or just to understand the structure.  Some parts will require knowledge of *relational databases* or *SQL*, but some parts are meant to be accessible to curious or ambitious *non-technical* users.

[Application](pages/application/application-index.html) is for those who want to interact directly with the code of the front-end app to make repairs or updates.  This will all be fairly technical and require *programming knowledge*.
