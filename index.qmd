The LIMS (Laboratory Inventory Management System) project consists of two components:    

- The user-facing application, using **C#** and **xaml** in the **WPF** framework and **.NET** platform.
- The backend database, stored in a **SQL Server Express 2019 database** on a local server machine.

The user-facing application runs on users' individual computers and connects to the central database so they can view, edit, and add new data about TerraMax production.

This documentation is organized into three sections:

[User Resources](/docs/user-resources/user-index.html) is for *non-technical* users who want a reference for how to set up, use, or troubleshoot the application. 

[Database](docs/database/database-index.html) is for anyone who wants to dig a bit deeper into the backend, whether to actively work on maintenance or updates, or just to understand the structure.  Some parts will require knowledge of *relational databases* or *SQL*, but some parts are meant to be accessible to curious or ambitious *non-technical* users.

[Application](docs/application/application-index.html) is for those who want to interact directly with the code of the front-end app to make repairs or updates.  This will all be fairly technical and require *programming knowledge*.
