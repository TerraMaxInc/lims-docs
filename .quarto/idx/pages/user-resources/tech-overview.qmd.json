The application references this file on startup to tell it what settings to use.  These settings include some that you can change from within the app:\n\n- `UseTestMode` - true or false, determines whether it connects to the real database or uses a small set of internal \"test data\"\n- `IsReadOnly` - true or false, determines whether the user can save to the database or just view what's already there\n- `DataTimeSpan` - a number representing days, determines the date range of past data that the application fetches.  It defaults to 365 (1 year) to save space and make the app run faster, but it's possible to change to a longer range if you need to view older data.\n\nThe file also contains the `connectionString`, which you cannot change from the app.  The connection string tells the app how to find the database, and should usually be left alone.
